        <p>
          I am from Lod, Israel born and raised. since childhood, I always tried
          to design and create things in my own unique way. Especially when it
          becomes useful to others.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a former Basketball-player, I know all about teamwork and the
          importance of being a part of a group, At my coding Bootcamp, it was
          easy for me to connect and communicate with my classmates which leads
          to more understanding, and problem-solving much faster!
